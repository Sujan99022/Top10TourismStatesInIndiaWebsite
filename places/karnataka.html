              Famously known as The City of Palaces, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Mysore, currently Mysuru, is one of the most important places in the country regarding ancient reigns. It is replete with the history of its dazzling royal heritage, intricate architecture, its famed silk sarees, yoga, and sandalwood, to name just a few. Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills, Mysore is the third most populated city in Karnataka, and its rich heritage draws millions of tourists all year round. The highlight is the majestic Mysore Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a must-visit.
              <br>
              &nbsp;Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile British Empire of India. To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as one of the most spectacular palaces in India. A very famous tourist spot that sees thousands of visitors milling in and around it every day, the Mysore Palace is a mesmerizing example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, every inch of the palace drips with opulence and intricate details, and every room that you visit stands out in terms of its elaborate architecture, beautiful paintings, rich colours and stained-glass windows. On every Sunday, and during the Dussehra celebrations, the palace is spectacularly lit up once dusk falls.

              Hampi
             </p>
             <p class="placeDetails text-justify">
Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.
<br>
&nbsp;Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here. Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives an authentic feel to the ruins.

              Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and very few Indians are seen across. Gokarna is not very conventionally touristy. The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed pace. Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands, Gokarna is a 'one of a kind' place in the country.

             <p class="placeDetails text-justify">
              The second-highest plunge waterfall in India, Jog Falls is a major tourist attraction in Karnataka and is the highest waterfall in the state. Second, to the Nohkalikai Falls of Meghalaya, Jog falls drops about a huge 253 m (850 ft. ) in a single fall. However, due to the construction of Linganamakki Dam which is a hydroelectricity plant closeby, the flow in the falls is hugely restricted before monsoons. So, it is best to go during the Monsoon season to see the falls in its full form.
              <br>
              &nbsp;Jog Falls is a 2 hours drive from the main Shimoga city. Also known as Gerosappa Falls or the Joga Falls, this seasonal waterfall is broken into four segments - Raja, Roarer, Rocket and Rani. They're named based on certain characteristics of the streams. Raja is an unbroken stream, Roarer is a strong and violent current that gushes down to meet the Raja stream, Rocket flows down in different jets and Rani is a quiet stream with falls in foam. Next time you visit, try identifying the streams!

              Bangalore

             <p class="placeDetails text-justify">
              Having evolved gradually from being the Garden city to the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore is India's third-largest city. Bangalore is loved for its pleasant weather, beautiful parks and the many lakes here. Bangalore is renowned for its eateries, street food corners, quirky cafes, coffee roasters and pubs dotting every corner of the city, serving cuisines from all over the world. Brunches, buffets, burgers, rooftop cafes, late-night eats - Bangalore has it all.
              <br>
              &nbsp;Here, one can choose to take a long stroll through the beautiful Cubbon Park, shop in the many malls or street markets or hop into one of the many acclaimed breweries for a cold and refreshing drink. There are a huge number of beautifully decorated parks in the city that are ideal for going on a morning stroll or a jog. One walk through the 300-acre Cubbon Park, or the botanical gardens of Lalbagh, and you'll know precisely why Bangalore is so famously called India's 'Garden City'.
              <br>
              &nbsp;But just like every big city, the unprecedented growth of IT in Bangalore has reshaped quite a few things including rising temperatures, polluted lakes and heavily congested roads, especially in the newer areas. Aside from the central business and commercial districts (and the roads leading up to them), the neighbourhoods of Bangalore are mostly quiet and serene, especially the older parts of the city like Jayanagar and J.P Nagar.
